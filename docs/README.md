# Discord Server Events

This is a calendar subscription file for events on a [Discord Server](https://discord.com/).

I created this because there currently isn't a way to subcribe to a calendar feed for Discord events other than to export and import them as needed.

## Subscribe to Calendar

Add the [ICS file](https://seriouslysean.github.io/discord-server-events-feed/dist/events.ics) to your calendar app.

```

```
